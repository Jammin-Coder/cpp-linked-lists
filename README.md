# C++ Linked Lists
My implementation of doubley-linked lists in C++ 
## NOTE:
This library is best used when you need a dynamicly sized list, and staticly sized arrays are not an option. 
So don't go too crazy with this code. It's always best to try and find a work-around solution before relying 
on linked-lists to bail you out. 

## To use:
Include LinkedList.cpp in cpp file:  
`#include "LinkedList.cpp"`  

Instantiate a new List object:  
`List<TYPE> myList = List<TYPE>(); `  

TYPE specifies the type of data to be stored in the list.  

### Examples:
#### Check out the code in `main.cpp` for some more examples! Go ahead and compile and run it too!
#### Docs to come soon...
